# Iron Bar

Iron is synonym for chain and bar is a synonym for block.  This project
is to develop a block chain protocol that can be used in authentication scenerios
like games.

It's not limited to games, just an example.

# Design
### Nodes
Nodes are center piece of Iron Bar.  They handle all of the block chain transactions.

One running node will be sufficient to use Iron bar, but that is not recommended.  At a minimum,
4 nodes should be running.
